## Overview

This 1 day What They Forgot (WTF) To Teach You About R workshop is for experienced R and RStudio users who want to (re)design their R lifestyle via project-oriented workflows and version control for data science (Git/GitHub). At the conclusion of the workshop you will have strategies for organizing data science projects and workflows, employing robust file paths, constructing human and machine readable file names, and facilitating collaboration with yourself or others via version control.

This course will be appropriate for you if you answer yes to these questions:

1. Have you been using R for a while and feel there might be better ways to organize your R life, but don't know what they are?

2. Do you want to put programming on pause and learn about actionable programming-adjacent workflows for streamlining analysis in R?

3. Are you willing to feel a bit of (git) pain to leverage the benefits of version control for collaboration and time travel?


## Prework

1. Please be ready with current versions of both R and RStudio. This means R>= 4.3.1 and RStudio >= 2023.06.1+524, unless you have a good reason otherwise. See the discussion in Install or upgrade R and RStudio: https://happygitwithr.com/install-r-rstudio.html#install-r-rstudio

2. It is essential that you do the requested pre-workshop Git/GitHub setup in advance: https://happygitwithr.com/workshops.html#pre-workshop-set-up

3. Install VS Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/), optionally with R language support (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=REditorSupport.r).

4. Install the following packages:
`install.packages(c("tidyverse", "rmarkdown", "usethis", "fs", "here"))`
